In order to compile the driver, you will need:

Compiling:

1) Clone this repository
2) Run inside the cloned repository:
	git submodule init
	git submodule update --remote
3) then use freebsd_build.sh to compile and install the modules.
4) kldload mlx5en (assuming linuxapi module is already installed or loaded).
